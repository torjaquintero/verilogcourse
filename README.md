Repository with Verilog HDL exercises to learn digital design with FPGAs. Each folder includes source code and a testbench. Difficulty increases progressively. Ideal for students, self-learners, and engineers using Vivado and the Nexys A7 board.

## Exercise No. 0
This introductory exercise consists of a simple Verilog module that directly connects the state of 16 switches to 16 LEDs on the Nexys A7 board. Its purpose is to familiarize the user with basic Verilog syntax, port definitions, and direct signal assignment, serving as a foundation for understanding the digital design flow.
